# 🕹️ Open-Source HTML Games Collection

## 📁 Repository Overview

This repository is a growing personal collection of **open-source HTML games** I have built, primarily using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The repository is designed as a centralized hub to showcase and host various small, accessible game projects.

Each game is entirely self-contained within its own dedicated folder (e.g., `/Hyper-Hunt`) in the root directory.

### Contribution & Open Source

While I am the primary author of these games, the entire collection is **open for all forms of contribution**, including:
* **Bug fixes** and code optimization.
* **Feature suggestions** and implementation.
* **Documentation improvements.**

## 🎮 Hyper Hunt

**Hyper Hunt** is a fast-paced, level-based tapping game where the player's primary objective is to **catch animals by tapping on them** before time runs out.

### Game Details

* **Technology Stack:** The game is built using standard **HTML** and **JavaScript** for core logic, styled using **CSS**, and integrated with **Bootstrap** for a responsive design.
* **Difficulty:** The game currently features **12 distinct levels**. As the player progresses, the difficulty increases significantly: the time allowed to clear the level and the chance to successfully pass the game get increasingly **slim**.
* **Features:** The project includes a dedicated **profile page** to track individual progress and a **leaderboard page** to foster friendly competition among players.

### 🌟 Progressive Web App (PWA) Capabilities

**Every game in this collection is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA)**, including Hyper Hunt. This offers enhanced user experience:

* **Offline Play:** Once loaded, the game can be played entirely **offline** thanks to service workers caching the necessary assets.
* **Downloadable/Installable:** Users can choose to **"install"** the game directly onto their desktop or mobile device for easy, full-screen access.

### How to Play

To play Hyper Hunt, simply navigate to the `/Hyper-Hunt` folder and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
